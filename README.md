EchoFrame

This is a simple full stack UI interface designed to be used with ollama. The frontend/backend both run on a local web server, and ollama provides the model to the dark-mode interface. 

A dropdown selector allows you to change the selected model. Currently, the only options are LLaMa 2, Mistral, and Gemma - however I plan to add support for any .gguf model in the near future. 
Additionally, you'll find a simple token/ram count. This is just meant to be informational about the interaction in terms of computation. 

As it stands right now, it's a locally hosted web app. But here soon it'll be a full offline LLM GUI. 

It's kinda of a simple fun way to jump right into an interaction with a language model. I hope you enjoy!
